What is so problematic about having a mehod to create a Counter with an arbitray constant value?
the way counters are implemented has a few more places that make it hard to use it with other than
numerical values (but that might be nice to have, imo).

This method is needed if one wants to do some algebra with the counters. or what are the operations defined for?
if i just want to throw out all counts below 11, all i would have to do, is subtract a constant counter.

The current situation is, that there is no other intrinsic way to initialize a counter bit having it count.
but what, if somebody would for example choose to use a counter as a generator rather than a storage?

Huh? i just read the comment about it. (Line 496+). Just ???
Why should setting the value to 1 mean that no element can have a count greater than what? Please explain.
