i like the keyword variant more. it uses less code and still very clean. but a little confusing, probably.
('give me the most common ... from the bottom' is kind of a late turn)

the second variant is a no-brainer to code, and it's invocation will likely be understood more easily.

i think the least counts are often just the second thing somebody asks for, after you tell him the most common.
for that reason i find that this feature should be included, since it's also already almost there.
