iops are more verbose to test.
but i think that, especially since it is mentioned in the comment, that this op should be .
also the routine is muuch more memory-efficient, and gives a better runtime as well.

add some quality here. pytests on the way.
doctest only covers 6/8 cases that would need testing (there_l, there_r, outcome_lives)
not count > 0 is on purpose.
