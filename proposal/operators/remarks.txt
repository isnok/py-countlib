i knnow, iops are more verbose to test.
implementing this might break code, that subclasses Counter, overrides the __add__ method
and does not implement a new __iadd__ method, but uses += or similar.
These can in my eyes be considered not very common.

but i think that, especially since it is mentioned in the comment, that the operation +=
should be implemented efficiently.  also the new routine is muuch more memory-saving, and
should give better run times as well.

i will add some quality to this proposal. pytests on the way.
doctest only covers 6/8 cases that would need testing (there_l, there_r, outcome_lives)

the not count > 0 is on purpose, but might need reconsideration since i just found out,
that comparison seemingly never raises an error.
