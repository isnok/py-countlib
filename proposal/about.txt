i have a personal background in mathematics. In fact i studied it for 8 good years
specializing in algebra. And i am also very affine to python, and do by now program
in it for about ten years.

The extensive review of the Counter class, that i present here, is a result of both
of these personal interests: python and algebra.

I would like to help improve the issues that i found by delivering constructive feedback
and also share some new ideas that i had during implementation of my own Counter class.
May it be of good use.
