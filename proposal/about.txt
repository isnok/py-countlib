i have a background in mathematics. I studied it for 8 good years specializing in algebra.
And i am also very affine to python, and do by now program with it for more than ten years.

The extensive review of the Counter class, that i present here, is a result of both
interests: python and algebra.

I would like to help improve the issues that i found and deliver some constructive feedback.
Also sharing some new ideas i had during implementation of my own Counter class.

I had some data analysis to do, and stumbled across the Counter again. This time i wanted to subclass it
just to capuslate some calculation stuff in the right place. that was almost the start of this lib.
i was thinking it more of a vector aproach, and at first i implemented scalar operations, and more.
When i came to making this implementation compatible to the i realized, that i had diverged from the stdlib
quite more than expected. Further investigations unearthed a lot of different versions of the Counter source,
and thus i suspect, that it is still not too mature, and might benefit from some constructive code & feedback.
